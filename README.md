Anki flashcard deck for learning yojijukugo.

I used the earliest form of this deck to pass the Kanji Kentei Level 2 in January of 2025.

This deck is mainly composited from two existing Yomitan dictionaries, both of which have pulled their respective information from different online yojijukugo dictionaries.
